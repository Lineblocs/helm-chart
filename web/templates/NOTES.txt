Lineblocs web charts need a database secret !

Please provide a db-secret with the following format:
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: db-secret
  namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
type: Opaque
data:
  DB_HOST: <host>
  DB_SCHEMA: <schema>
  DB_USER: <username>
  DB_PASS: <password>

But do not forget every other secret you referenced in the chart.

Also, be sure that a metrics-server is present on the destination cluster. You can check if it is installed with the
following command:

kubectl get deploy,svc -n kube-system | grep metrics-server
